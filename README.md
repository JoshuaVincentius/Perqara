This is the notebook file for the assessment case study made by me. There are several datasets including customers, geolocation, orders, order items, order payments, order reviews, products, product category in english and sellers dataset. The project itself is about processing all that datasets by ingesting, cleaning and exploring the data. At the end, you can find several interesting insights about the data itself.
